# code 2 dia
A library of tools to help create diagrams of code manually or automatically, to help with understanding.

## Inspiration
- PlantUML
    - Creating component diagrams from text is awesome. PlantUML is the backend to code2dia.
- rqt_graph
    - Shows nodes and topics in a very clean, practical way. Awesome tool.
- https://www.gituml.com/
    - An attempt to create UML diagrams from code. However, it does not have nesting like plantUML has, which is a key capability I aim to exploit in this project.
